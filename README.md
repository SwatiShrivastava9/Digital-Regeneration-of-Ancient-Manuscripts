# Digital-Regeneration-of-Ancient-Manuscripts

This project comes with the important challenge of image processing for rejuvenation and preservation of ancient Sanskrit manuscripts with the help of advanced techniques related to machine learning. It begins with data classification into three categories: ”most tempered,” ”moderately tempered,” and ”least tempered” according to their visual integrity with the help of pixel density and a threshold value. Making use of OCR technology - particularly Tesseract and Google OCR-to identify and extract the text from partially damaged manuscripts and test the effectiveness of these tools.

One of the methodological elements is pixel density-based detection of text regions and drawing of bounding boxes around these regions for further processing. The project also involves a holistic approach towards character recognition, which includes the breaking up of text into lines, thinning of characters, and extraction of the bounding boxes for individual characters. Additionally, in the project, there is a Siamese network for one-shot recognition of characters in Devanagari script for enhancing the accuracy of recognition. It calculates cosine similarity and is trained on pairs of images to detect characters with great efficiency.

Combining these innovative techniques, we are hoping to identify and determine the various characters as part of restoring the lost parts of ancient manuscripts. This contributes to the field of digital humanities because this shows how machine learning can help in preserving and understanding historical artifacts. Its results would entail huge implications for initiatives on cultural heritage since it would provide for more efficient and accurate transcription of manuscripts.
